generating tree
- handle/test go to's
- aib018y	- too big


			
generating flowchart
- loopbreakpointer, goto
- zoom
- positioning of chart
- go to : jump to para instead of line joining the two as itll be messy
- proper spacing of branches
- proper spacing of blocks
- proper terminating(GOBACK, GO TO) and joining(end of IF) of branches
- program calls to be ignored/para's not to be expanded
- opening new flowchart on double-click
- go to - 
			p1.
			....
			p2.
			go to p1.
- flowchart map?
